            <h2>Hour of code: Teaching new genaeration</h2>
            <p>
                On <strong>November 8, Victory Day of Azerbaijan</strong>, our team, consisting of 4 members, 
                <a class="member" href="#">Nihat Shukurov</a>, <a class="member" href="#">Elton Guliyev</a>, 
                <a class="member" href="#">Yusif Karimov</a>, and <a class="member" href="#">Bakhshali Bakhshaliyev</a>, 
                went to <strong>Academic Development Center (Akademik İnkişaf Mərkəzi)</strong> to hold an event called 
                <strong>Code of Hour</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During this event, we taught <strong>20 children</strong> the basics of programming using the activity 
                <strong>“Minecraft Journey”</strong>, chosen for its familiarity to children. 
                Thanks to <strong>ADC (AIM)</strong>, we were warmly welcomed and provided with all the necessary equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The event began with an introduction to <strong>ADA University</strong>, where we discussed students' opinions 
                about their future. We then explained the <strong>Blockly language</strong> through the “Minecraft Journey” 
                activity, focusing on tasks and logic. Students were actively involved, sharing solutions and feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the event, we ensured that everyone understood the concept, gathered their feedback, and distributed 
                certificates. We believe that no matter where they end up, understanding the basics of coding and algorithms is 
                essential.
