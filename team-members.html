        <article>
            My name is Bakhshali Bakhshaliyev, and I am a student at ADA University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in
            Computer Science. <br>I was always interested in competitive programming. Outside of academics, I am a
            person
            who loves going to the gym and listening to Vagif Mustafazadeh. <br>This helps me to stay strong physically
            and
            mentally. One of my favorite people is Pavel Durov, because of his biography and team management abilities.
            <br>
            I consider myself a show fanatic. I believe that sometimes our best decisions are the ones that don't
            make sense at all.
